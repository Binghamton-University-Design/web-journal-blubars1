					<h2>I Have a Thing for Avocados</h2>
					<p><img src="WebImages/final-project-avocado.png"></p>
					<p>My icon project showcased avocado toast. Kevin gave me the idea to base my final project on avocados and the history of avocados. I had a lot of fun with this one, my dad even brought me a bunch of avocados to look at while I worked on this project at home. It was really fun.

					<h2>Articles and Art</h2>

					<p><img src="WebImages/Article-2.png"></p>
					<p><img src="WebImages/Article-3.png"></p>
					<p>I couldnt decide what I wanted to do my articles on (notice a consistant pattern of indeciciveness here?), but I found an Article on Ayahuasca and decided to run with the drug theme. This <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/15/fashion/ayahuasca-a-strong-cup-of-tea.html?searchResultPosition=1" target="_blank">First Article</a> is about how Ayahuasca is a very strong tea-like drug that helps people change their lives through the visons they recieve from it. This <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/science/cbd-thc-cannabis-cannabidiol.html?searchResultPosition=3" target="_blank">second article</a>is about how THC was found in a childs DNA, it turns out the father accidentally gave his son honey that had been laced with Marijuana. He was criminalized, but THC and CBD should be decriminalized. My <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/opinion/opioid-crisis-drug-users.html?module=inline" target="_blank">third article</a> is about the Opioid epidemic and how it effects all races, and is not just effecting minorities. Many people suffer from addiction to Opioids, and it is only getting worse.

					<h2>Icons That Tickle My Elbow</h2>
					<p><img src="WebImages/Icons-Bashel.png"></p>
					<p>I had a lot of difficulty deciding what my icons should be. I asked a bunch of my friends and they all said paintbrush, hence the paintbrush. I really like avocado toast, hence the avocado toast. My friends all hate the hand, they don't think it represents me at all... but I think they're wrong. Once I figured out what I wanted to do, I had a lot of fun with creating these icons. I created them using the same shape, as well as shapebuilder, and making sure they were all slightly coming out of the lines.

					<h2>Baby Bash, The Isometric Avatar</h2>
					<p><img src="WebImages/Avatar.png"></p>
					<p>This is little ol' me, her name is Baby Bash. Her tongue is out because... well so is mine in the picture of me in my bio. She's holding a paintbrush because I have an art business and since she is my mini me, so does she. The paint is dripping onto her shoes because all of my clothes have paint stains. I made sure to include piercings, a star necklace, and converse because those are with me every day! I had a lot of fun creating her because I had a lot of freedom with what she could look like and what her personality would be.

					<p>Hi! I'm Bashel Lubarsky, a senior studying Graphic Design at Binghamton University. I have two dogs names Albus Dumbledog and Bellatrix LePup, and I love painting and photography. I like making cool or funny art and I am also afraid of graduating and becoming a real human being, but it's chill...
