					<h2>Icons That Tickle My Elbow</h2>
					<p><img src="WebImages/Icons-Bashel.png"></p>
					<p>I had a lot of difficulty deciding what my icons should be. I asked a bunch of my friends and they all said paintbrush, hence the paintbrush. I really like avocado toast, hence the avocado toast. My friends all hate the hand, they don't think it represents me at all... but I think they're wrong. Once I figured out what I wanted to do, I had a lot of fun with creating these icons. I created them using the same shape, as well as shapebuilder, and making sure they were all slightly coming out of the lines.

					<h2>Baby Bash, The Isometric Avatar</h2>
					<p><img src="WebImages/Avatar.png"></p>
					<p>This is little ol' me, her name is Baby Bash. Her tongue is out because... well so is mine in the picture of me in my bio. She's holding a paintbrush because I have an art business and since she is my mini me, so does she. The paint is dripping onto her shoes because all of my clothes have paint stains. I made sure to include piercings, a star necklace, and converse because those are with me every day! I had a lot of fun creating her because I had a lot of freedom with what she could look like and what her personality would be.

					<p>Hi! I'm Bashel Lubarsky, a senior studying Graphic Design at Binghamton University. I have two dogs names Albus Dumbledog and Bellatrix LePup, and I love painting and photography. I like making cool or funny art and I am also afraid of graduating and becoming a real human being, but it's chill...
